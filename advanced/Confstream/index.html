<p>
The Confstream API is an abstraction layer for dealing with arbitrary
sources of configuration information.  These sources, which can be text files,
SQL tables, LDAP servers, DBM hashes, etc, are represented by "configuration
stream" objects.  These objects allow multiple sources of configuration
information to be used in a scalable manner.

<p>
This layer was structured so that third-party modules could easily define
a set of custom configuration streams that can read and write configuration
information.  It is also possible for one module to use another module's
confstreams, if it knows the correct type of stream to look for.

<p>
The Confstream module developer should read the description of the
confstream <a href="structure.html">object</a> first, then the
<a href="functions.html">functions</a> for working with these objects.
There is also a <a href="development.html">development</a> document that
contains some suggestions and notes to keep in mind when devising one's
own confstream objects.
