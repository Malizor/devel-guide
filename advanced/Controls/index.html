<p>
The Controls API provides a way to talk to the running server and request
that module-defined server-side actions be performed, such as requesting a
list of currently supported configuration directives, or banning a certain user
or host from connecting to the server.  This is done by registering custom
control handlers that are keyed using an <i>action</i>, a specific command
requested by a client, such as &quot;restart&quot; or &quot;ban&quot;.  The
communication between controls clients and the running server is done via
a Unix domain socket, with the server side of the socket being implemented
by <code>mod_ctrls</code>.

<p>
A developer wishing to make use of the capabilities of controls should read the
description of the control <a href="structure.html">objects</a> first, then the
<a href="functions.html">functions</a> for working with these objects.  There
is also a <a href="development.html">development</a> document that contains
some suggestions and notes to keep in mind when devising one's own controls
and control handlers.
