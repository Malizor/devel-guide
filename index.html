<p>
<b>Purpose</b><br>
For any given program or application, almost every user or developer poses
questions of &quot;How do I get <i>X</i> program to do <i>Y</i> nifty
thing?&quot; The ProFTPD server is structured similar to the Apache web
server, and can be extended through modules, much like Apache.  Consequently,
this extending or hacking-in of new functionality and capabilities is most
easily done by developing a module, rather than changing the source code
itself.

<p>
ProFTPD modules are designed to handle and respond to configuration
directives at startup, to FTP commands sent over the control connection by
FTP clients, and to authentication requests.  Here is more in-depth
<a href="introduction.html">introduction</a> to ProFTPD modules, and how
they tick.

<p>
Unless otherwise stated, this information is relevant for the current version
of ProFTPD.  Any opinions, ideas, and philosophies contained herein are my
own, or those of the contributors, and do not reflect the ideas or
philosophies of my employer.

<p>
<b>Audience</b><br>
This manual is intended for system administrators and programmers who wish to
develop modules and patches for the ProFTPD FTP server.  Readers should be
comfortable programming in a Unix environment, be familiar with C, and
be aware of how the FTP protocol works.  These documents aim to provide an
explanation of the inner workings of ProFTPD and its modules, and how to
develop them.  Readers should therefore have in interest in these topics, else they may be bored.

<p>
<b>Additions and Contributions</b><br>
The current manual is not yet complete. I will continue to work on it as I
find time. Feel free to send in material for the TODO sections, and
for the small notes I've left around. Also, compatibility is an issue
I struggle with sometimes. The best I can do for some Unix flavors is
read man pages. Corrections, addendums, and notes for compatibility are
greatly appreciated. All contributions, comments, and criticisms are welcome,
and can be sent to <i>tj@castaglia.org</i>.

<b>Comments</b><br>
One final important thing to note: this documentation is an attempt to explain
what the actual code is doing; the only true canonical source for answers to
any questions that might arise is the source code itself.  This documentation
may, and most likely will, fall out of date, or not properly reflect what the
code is doing.  Therefore, the author of these documents should not be held
responsible if ProFTPD is not behaving exactly as described here.  Instead,
s/he should be held responsible for not describing things exactly as ProFTPD is behaving.  As always, <em>caveat emptor</em>.<br>
