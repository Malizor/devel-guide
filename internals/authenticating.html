<b>ProFTPD's Authentication Process</b><br>
When an FTP client connects to a <code>proftpd</code> server, it needs to
authenticate itself, as per the FTP protocol.  The clients send a
<code>USER</code> command followed by a <code>PASS</code> command in most cases.

<p>
Upon receiving a <code>USER</code> command, <code>proftpd</code> will first
check to see if the requested user is allowed to log in, based on any
<code>&lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;</code> directives.  Then it will check to see if the
login is allowed by any configured <code>MaxClients</code>,
<code>MaxClientsPerHost</code>, and <code>MaxHostsPerUser</code> directives.
If these directives mean that the client connection cannot be accepted,
any configured <code>DisplayGoAway</code> message is sent to the client.

<p>
When <code>proftpd</code> receives a <code>PASS</code> command, it will again
check for configured <code>MaxClients</code>, <code>MaxClientsPerHost</code>,
and <code>MaxHostsPerUser</code> limits.  The first check, during the handling
of the <code>USER</code> command, handles <code>UserAlias</code>ed usernames;
this check handles <i>real</i> usernames.  The actual work of authenticating
the user then takes place (more on this below).  If the authentication
succeeds, any <code>DisplayLogin</code> and <code>AccessGrantMsg</code>
messages are sent to the client.  Otherwise, any <code>AccessDenyMsg</code>
message is sent.

<p>
<b>Authenticating the User</b><br>
During authentication, the process handling the connection is running under
the identity configured using the <code>User</code> and <code>Group</code>
configuration directives.  Only after successfully authenticating the user
will the process assume the identity and privileges of that user.  This
process of authentication is handled by the
<code><a href="../src/modules/mod_auth.c.html#_setup_environment">_setup_environment()</a></code> function, and involves quite a bit.

<p>
First, this function determines whether the login request is for an
<code>&lt;Anonymous&gt;</code> server, or for a real user.  Unknown users
are rejected at this point.  The determination of &quot;known&quot; user
is done via the <a href="../api/functions.html#auth_getpwnam"><code>auth_getpwnam()</code></a> dispatch function, an abstraction of the
<code>getpwnam(3)</code> function.  Modules that wish to supply their
own authentication routines will need to provide <b>all</b> of the
dispatched authentication functions mentioned
<a href="../handlers/authentication.html">here</a>.  This dispatch function
&quot;cascades&quot; through each of the registered authentication modules of
the server, asking each module in turn to authenticate the user until an
error is encountered or until a module successfully returns the requested
information.  This design allows multiple authentication schemes to be present
simultaneously.

<p>
The
<a href="../api/functions.html#auth_getgroups"><code>auth_getgroups()</code></a>
dispatch function is similarly used to request the supplemental group
membership information, both group names and group IDs, from authentication
modules.  The list of obtained group IDs, if any, will subsequently be
passed on to <code>setgroups(2)</code>.  At this point, I would like to
point out a common error message pertaining to supplemental group
membership:
<pre>
"unable to set groups: Invalid argument"
</pre>
This message will occur for one of two reasons: negative IDs for the user,
or the user is a member of more than the maximum allowable number of groups
(NGROUPS, NGROUPS_MAX,
     _SC_NGROUPS_MAX         NGROUPS_MAX                Max simultaneous
                                                        groups to which
                                                        one may belong
)

<p>
Next, the function will check to see if the requested user is
<code>root</code>; logging in as <code>root</code> requires that the
<code>RootLogin</code> directive be explicitly set, as this is a very
bad idea.  If the requested user is a member of an <code>AnonymousGroup</code>
group, then <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code>ed logins are again checked for the
user.

<p>
At this point, the given password is checked.  If any <code>UserPassword</code>
directives are set, then the configured password will be checked using
<code><a href="../api/functions.html#auth_check">auth_check()</a></code> abstracted authentication handler.  If not, then the
<code><a href="../api/functions.html#auth_authenticate">auth_authenticate()</a></code> handler will be called.  Should user authentication fail, then
groups-based authentication, using the given password as a group password
and/or any <code>GroupPassword</code> configuration directives, will be
attempted.

<p>
If the requested user has succeeded up to this point, the default directory
in which to place the user, either their home directory or any applicable
<code>DefaultChdir</code> directives, is retrieved.  This path is checked
for any applicable <code>&lt;Limit&gt;</code> directives.  Next, after
logging a <code>wtmp</code> or <code>utmp</code> log (unless configured
not to), this function will check and apply any <code>DefaultRoot</code>
configuration directives as needed.  Last, the identity of the current process
is changed to be that of the authenticated user.

<p>
At this point, unless authentication has failed at any point earlier,
the authentication process is done.  Any <code>.ftpaccess</code> files
are parsed, the default transfer mode is set (configurable via the
<code>DefaultTransferMode</code> directive), and scoreboard files updated.

<p>
Authentication is a complex process, and may fail at several points: if
an authentication module encounters an error while authenticating, if
the login is not for a valid user or is not a valid <code>UserAlias</code>,
if the login is denied by an applicable <code>&lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;</code>,
if the password given was incorrect or expired, if the account used
is disabled, if the user's account includes an invalid shell, if the login
name is listed in a <code>/etc/ftpusers</code> file and the server is
configured to honour that file, <i>etc</i>.
