<b><code>.ftpaccess</code> files</b><br>
A <code>.ftpaccess</code> file is meant to function like Apache's
<code> .htaccess</code> file: a file that acts as free-floating section
of the server's configuration file.  If a <code>.ftpaccess</code> file is
present in a directory in which the server looks, it will parse that
<code>.ftpaccess</code> file as a configuration file, and act accordingly.
Only some configuration directives are allowed in the <code>.ftpaccess</code>
context, though. The advantage of having this capability is that users can
customize how the server treats directories that are under the user's control
via files placed in those directories, instead of allowing the user to modify
the main server configuration file itself.  The disadvantage is that a user is
capable of possibly overriding a configuration value that was set in the main
configuration file for a specific purpose.  

<p>
The server treats a directory that contains a <code>.ftpaccess</code> file
exactly as if the configuration directives in that file had been placed in
a <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> section in the main <code>proftpd.conf</code>
file.  For example, if there is a <code>/home/users/bob</code> directory on
your system, and in that directory there was a <code>.ftpaccess</code> file
that contained:
<pre>
DirFakeUser on ~
DirFakeGroup on ~
Umask 0077
</pre>
it would be treated exactly as if:
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /home/users/bob&gt;
    DirFakeUser on ~
    DirFakeGroup on ~
    Umask 0077
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
was written into <code>proftpd.conf</code>.
