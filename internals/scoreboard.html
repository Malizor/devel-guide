<b>What is the scoreboard?</b><br>
The scoreboard file is a file used by the daemon to store statistics
about each current FTP session.  It records things such as the process
ID of the session, the IP address of the client and server involved,
the FTP command issued, the current working directory, file transfer
status, etc.  All of this information is stored in a single file,
located using the <code>ScoreboardFile</code> directive.  This file is
in a fixed-length record binary format.  This means that the file is not
easily legible, however, the binary format makes for faster I/O.  This is
important, as the daemon is constantly reading and writing to the scoreboard,
updating fields for every current session.

<p>
<b>How is the scoreboard used?</b><br>
The scoreboard is used by the <code>ftpcount</code>, <code>ftptop</code>,
and <code>ftpwho</code> utilities, for reporting on the status of the
running <code>proftpd</code> daemon and its current sessions.  The daemon
itself makes use of the scoreboard by using it to track and enforce such
limits as <code>MaxClients</code>, <code>MaxClientsPerHost</code>,
<code>MaxClientsPerUser</code>, and <code>MaxHostsPerUser</code>.

<p>
<b>Scoreboard API</b><br>
The primary object of interest, when dealing with the scoreboard
programmatically, is the <code>pr_scoreboard_entry_t</code>, shown
below:
<pre>
  typedef struct {
    pid_t sce_pid;
    uid_t sce_uid;
    gid_t sce_gid;
    char sce_user[32];
    p_in_addr_t *sce_server_ip;
    int sce_server_port;
    char sce_server_addr[80], sce_server_name[32];
    char sce_client_addr[80];
    char sce_class[32];
    char sce_cwd[PR_TUNABLE_SCOREBOARD_BUFFER_SIZE];
    char sce_cmd[PR_TUNABLE_SCOREBOARD_BUFFER_SIZE];
    time_t sce_begin_idle, sce_begin_session;
    off_t sce_xfer_size, sce_xfer_done;

  } pr_scoreboard_entry_t;
</pre>

<p>
For code that wishes to deal with the scoreboard, the Scoreboard API
functions are as follows (from <a href="../src/include/scoreboard.h.html"<code>include/scoreboard.h</code></a>):
<pre>
  const char *pr_get_scoreboard(void);
  int pr_set_scoreboard(const char *<i>file</i>);
  int pr_close_scoreboard(void);
  void pr_delete_scoreboard(void);
  int pr_open_scoreboard(int <i>mode</i>, pid_t *<i>daemon_pid</i>);
  int pr_restore_scoreboard(void);
  int pr_rewind_scoreboard(void);
  int pr_scoreboard_add_entry(void);
  int pr_scoreboard_del_entry(unsigned char);
  pr_scoreboard_entry_t *pr_scoreboard_read_entry(void);
  int pr_scoreboard_update_entry(pid_t <i>pid</i>, ...);
</pre>

<p>
The <code>pr_get_scoreboard()</code> function simply returns the full path
to the current scoreboard file.

<p>
The <code>pr_set_scoreboard()</code> function is used to change the location
of the scoreboard file.  This should be called before the scoreboard is
opened.

<p>
The <code>pr_close_scoreboard()</code> function does just that, closing
the scoreboard file and releasing any locks that may be present on the
scoreboard.

<p>
The <code>pr_delete_scoreboard()</code> function is used as part of the
daemon cleanup, during its shutdown process, to remove the scoreboard.  There
is no reason to leave a scoreboard around when the daemon is not running
(unless the daemon has a <code>ServerType</code> of <code>inetd</code>).

<p>
<code>pr_open_scoreboard()</code> is called to open the scoreboard.  The
given <i>mode</i> is the same as that given to <code>open(2)</code>, and
is usually <code>O_RDONLY</code>.  If non-NULL, <i>daemon_pid</i> will
point to the process ID of the currently running daemon for the
scoreboard upon return of the function.

<p>
The <code>pr_restore_scoreboard()</code> is used when done reading the
scoreboard.  It restores the file position pointer of the scoreboard to
the position it had before <code>pr_rewind_scoreboard()</code> was called.
Failure to call this function after using <code>pr_rewind_scoreboard()</code>
can result in corruption of the scoreboard.

<p>
<code>pr_rewind_scoreboard()</code> is used only when the scoreboard is
to be read through in its entirety.  Prior to interating through the
scoreboard entries, this function is called to position the file position
pointer at the start of the scoreboard.  Once done iterating, call
<code>pr_restore_scoreboard()</code> to restore the file position pointer
to where it was, prior to the scan of the scoreboard.

<p>
The <code>pr_scoreboard_add_entry()</code> function is called when a client
connects to the daemon, allocating a slot in the scoreboard to store the
statistics for the session.

<p>
The <code>pr_scoreboard_del_entry()</code> function is called when the
session is ending, to remove the scoreboard entry allocated for the
session from the scoreboard file.

<p>
The <code>pr_scoreboard_read_entry()</code> function reads the next
scoreboard entry from the scoreboard, and returns a pointer to the entry,
which is stored in a static buffer.

<p>
Finally, the <code>pr_scoreboard_update_entry()</code> function is used
to update each of the various fields of a scoreboard entry, each at
different times during the lifetime of the session.

<p>
These functions, however, are for use by modules, and daemon code.  For
external utilities, <i>e.g.</i> <code>ftptop</code> and <code>ftpwho</code>,
there is a slightly different API (from <a href="../src/utils/utils.h.html"<code>utils/utils.h</code></a>):
<pre>
  const char *util_get_scoreboard(void);
  int util_set_scoreboard(const char *<i>file</code>);
  int util_close_scoreboard(void);
  int util_open_scoreboard(int <i>mode</i>, pid_t *<i>daemon_pid</i>);
  pr_scoreboard_entry_t *util_scoreboard_read_entry(void);
</pre>
These are functionally the same as their <code>pr_</code>-prefixed equivalents,
except that they do not depend on the core code, thus avoiding many
dependencies irrelevent to an external utility.  These routines are read-only,
since there is no valid reason for an external utility to be changing
the contents of the scoreboard; such changes are for the daemon to make.
